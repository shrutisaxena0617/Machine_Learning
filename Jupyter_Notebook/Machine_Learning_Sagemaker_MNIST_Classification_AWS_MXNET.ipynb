    "The **SageMaker Python SDK** makes it easy to train and deploy MXNet models. In this assignment, I have used neural network using the Apache MXNet [Module API](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/module.html) and the MNIST dataset. This notebook is basically to explore and understand how to save and deploy a trained machine learning model. I have also included a TensorFlow code to build a model on the same dataset and even that can be used to deploy an API. However, my learning is that it took me several days to build a model from scratch using TensorFlow, however it was extremely easy and convenient to use this ot build or deploy the model and the accuracy is pretty awesome (99.8%) \n",
    "\n",
    "**About dataset** The MNIST dataset is widely used for handwritten digit classification, and consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). The task at hand is to train a model using the 60,000 training images and subsequently test its classification accuracy on the 10,000 test images."
